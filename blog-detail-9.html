                    Are you searching for ways to build and grow your online
                    audience? Whether you are an educator who is in the planning
                    phase of their online course creation journey or one who has
                    just finished creating their course after investing several
                    weeks and months into it, it is never too early or too late
                    to look for strategies to grow your audience.
                  </p>

                    Why do you need to build an audience for your online course?
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    You might have created a truly incredible course, the best
                    in the current market, however, if you cannot make it
                    accessible to your potential students the purpose of
                    providing quality education gets defeated. Regardless of the
                    subject that your course is based on, it is important that
                    you engage the segment of the audience who might be
                    prospective customers. To increase the success rate of your
                    course you should make significant efforts towards growing
                    your online audience.

                    To help you out with your audience building strategies, we
                    have compiled the following few tips that can greatly help
                    you achieve your goals.
                  </p>
                  <h6>1. Research your Target Audience</h6>
                  <p>
                    This is one of the most crucial steps you need to follow if
                    you are trying to operate a successful business. Make sure
                    to ask yourself the following questions while you are
                    researching the type of audience you are seeking:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Who is your ideal client?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Get information about the demographic, their income levels,
                    what their goals are and how you can help them achieve those
                    goals.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>How can I target this audience?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Acquire information about your target audience's preferred
                    mode of communication and what social media platforms such
                    as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram etc. they are active on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can gather these insights by making use of Google
                    Analytics(
                    <a
                      href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision"
                      >google analytics</a
                    >
                    )service and/or social media channels, for example, you can
                    discover important audience data by scouting the social
                    media channels of your competitors and get information such
                    as their follower locations, demographics and brand
                    mentions. Another productive way of gaining insights would
                    be to conduct surveys or polls to get direct feedback from
                    your followers or email subscribers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The goal here is to get a thorough character profile of your
                    target profile so that you can reach them more efficiently
                    in order to market your course. It is great if you already
                    have access to a sizeable audience, but it is essential that
                    you target the right people. These are the people who are
                    likely to get converted from being potential customers to
                    loyal customers.

                    2. Start a Blog to Benefit from Search Engine Optimization
                  </h6>
                  <p>
                    Nowadays, what do most people do when they want an answer to
                    their query?
                  </p>
                  <p>You probably guessed it, they conduct a Google search.</p>
                  <p>
                    Google is the world's most used search engine and naturally
                    has massive web traffic. The inevitable downside to this
                    fact is that every business wants this traffic, thus making
                    organic search highly competitive. In order to stand out
                    from the crowd, many course creators have realized the
                    importance of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Since you
                    are offering an educational service, it is likely that the
                    traffic you will be getting will be extremely targeted. That
                    is to say, if people are searching for an online course on,
                    say, JAVA programming they are interested in enrolling in
                    the course that best suits their needs which makes them
                    prospective customers. Hence, it is of utmost importance
                    that you invest your efforts in understanding and
                    implementing SEO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the best ways of getting a higher ranking in search
                    engine results is by starting a blog about your digital
                    product. Blogging is good for SEO because it helps with a
                    number of important ranking factors. If your blog content
                    has high-quality material on topics that are relevant to
                    your target audience, the overall performance of your
                    website on search engines can significantly increase. If you
                    want in-depth reasoning of why blogs are helpful for SEO
                    take a look at Alex Chris's blog post titled "Blogging Helps
                    SEO a Lot and Here is the Proof" [1].
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You should write blogs on your own website, but also publish
                    them on other people's websites. Guest blogging is also an
                    excellent device in case you do not have your own website.
                    Your blog content can help you grow your online course
                    audience and might even attract new email subscribers or
                    customers. Make sure that you mention the unique benefits of
                    signing up for your online course in the blog, provide a
                    link for the registration and also an option for signing up
                    to your email list.
                  </p>

                    3. Build Your Email List & Step-up Your Email Marketing
                    Campaign
                  </h6>
                  <p>
                    Email marketing refers to the use of emails to convert leads
                    into sales by sending personalized business messages to the
                    target audience. It is a budget-friendly way of reaching out
                    to your target audience and developing a productive client
                    relationship with them. Email marketing boasts a 4200% ROI,
                    that is, for every $1 you spend you get a staggering return
                    of $42 [2]. Therefore, many course creators involve it in
                    their marketing strategies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An important prerequisite of any email campaign is to have
                    an extensive email list. An email list, as the name
                    suggests, is a list of email addresses of people who have
                    opted to receive information from you via emails. In order
                    to cultivate a good business relationship with your email
                    subscribers, you need to make sure you leverage your email
                    list in the right manner. It is imperative that you provide
                    them with relevant and valuable content which does not seem
                    overly promotional.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Your email list can also be used if you have updates on
                    online product launches or discounts to share. You can also
                    use it to collect useful feedback from the people who have
                    already purchased or to conduct an opinion poll on how many
                    times the email subscribers would like to receive
                    promotional content. Another good content marketing strategy
                    is to use emails to provide teaser content to your
                    subscribers and encourage them to opt for the paid content
                    if they are interested.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Email marketing is a remarkable communication medium but it
                    is easy to get confused about how to best use it to sell
                    your course. If you need some assistance you can opt for
                    using email marketing tools. A basic email marketing tool
                    offers services to design your email template, create an
                    opt-in form, manage your email lists, track the analytics of
                    your campaigns among other useful services. Some of the
                    best-paid versions of email marketing tools offer all the
                    basic features in addition to email automation and
                    AI-powered analytics. We have a detailed post about the best

                    If you are a complete novice when it comes to content
                    marketing through emails it is unlikely you can learn the
                    traits of the trade overnight. Devote time and, if your
                    budget permits, money to understand and successfully
                    implement an effective email marketing strategy. But in the
                    meantime, here are some quick tips:
                  </p>
                  <h6>i) Always Personalize Your Emails:</h6>
                  <p>
                    -The most common way to personalize emails is to add the
                    receiver’s name to each email, even while sending bulk
                    emails.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    -Another way could be to send different emails to different
                    email subscribers depending on where they are in the
                    "Subscribers Into Customers" journey.
                  </p>
                  <h6>ii) Create a Catchy Subject Line</h6>
                  <p>
                    While writing the subject line, keep the following pointers
                    in mind:
                  </p>
                  <p>-Keep it simple and brief</p>
                  <p>
                    -Make sure it captures the gist of the purpose of the email
                  </p>
                  <p>-Use questions to generate interest</p>
                  <p>
                    -Personalize it to make the receiver feel more important
                  </p>
                  <h6>iii) Insert Graphics</h6>
                  <p>
                    -Images can lead to significantly better email performance.
                    They allow you to strengthen your message and include
                    information that can’t be communicated through text alone.
                  </p>

                    - Video content can greatly help pique the interest of the
                    recipient and makes the purpose of the email easily
                    understandable.

                  <h6>4. Create your Presence on Niche Social Networks</h6>
                  <p>
                    A niche social network is a platform that focuses on a
                    specific interest group or demographic. They are different
                    from the popular social media platforms of Facebook,
                    Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn, as they do not cater to
                    all audiences but to a particular subset of people. Because
                    niche social networks are concentrated on a specific
                    interest or group, they can provide relevant resources and
                    audiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As course creators, you can choose the niche social media
                    platforms according to your course topic. For instance, if
                    you have created a course on graphic design then it is a
                    good idea to establish your presence on platforms such as
                    <a href="https://www.behance.net/"> Behance</a> , which was
                    created for creative professionals to communicate, showcase
                    and advertise their work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Q&A sites such as Quora and Yahoo Answers and discussion
                    forums such as Reddit are also excellent venues to interact
                    with your niche audience and provide them with valuable
                    content free of cost. You can provide alluring offers like a
                    discount on the course to the first 10 people who sign up.
                    Answering questions that are relevant to your niche can work
                    in your favour as the users of these platforms might be
                    interested in checking out your website or giving their
                    email addresses to receive more details about your course.
                  </p>
                  <h6>5. Create Podcasts about the Topic of Your Course</h6>
                  <p>
                    A podcast is an online audio broadcast. Unlike a video or a
                    blog post, a podcast does away with the visual element hence
                    in that way, it is much easier to consume. Consumers list
                    various reasons to listen to a podcast but the top reason is
                    to gain knowledge. According to a report by Statista, around
                    75% of podcast consumers in the US say they enjoy tuning in
                    to podcasts to learn new things and do so on a monthly basis
                    [3]. Interestingly, according to a report by eMarketer,
                    statistics show that 54% of podcast listeners are either
                    somewhat or much more likely to consider buying from a brand
                    after hearing its advertisement on a podcast [4].
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Podcasts can serve as a valuable marketing tool for your
                    online course. Starting a podcast can help build your
                    credibility among your target audience and also other
                    professionals in your industry. For example, let's assume
                    you are a subject matter expert in political science.
                    Through a podcast, you can share your expertise with
                    interested consumers. You can even offer short lectures,
                    interesting insights and practical tips to excel in a career
                    in political science. The more people you help, the more
                    credibility you gain. You can now use this opportunity to
                    ask your listeners to sign up for your email list and to
                    encourage them to take your online course.

                  <h6>6. Offer a Free Mini-course</h6>
                  <p>
                    One of the best ways to increase your audience size for your
                    online course is by offering a "mini-course". This is
                    essentially equivalent to a free trial period or the free
                    teaser content that many online business platforms offer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In simple terms, you would be taking some of the quality
                    content from your main course, and offering it at no cost,
                    in exchange for the email address of the user.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After you do offer a free mini-course to prospective
                    students, things can go 2 ways:
                  </p>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                      The first is that users will appreciate the free sample
                      and want to sign up for a more comprehensive paid learning
                      program with you thus turning subscribers into customers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The other thing that can happen is that users might decide
                      that the online course product you are offering is not
                      what they want or that the mini-course was sufficient
                      enough for them. However, if a user gets results from your
                      course they are sure to recommend your course to other
                      people in their circle. Hence, you would be witnessing
                      audience growth through mouth referral alone.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    You can choose to publish your mini-course on the EZColab
                    platform. EZColab helps course creators to build and launch
