                    The rise of social media, the birth of blogger/influencer
                    culture and the fact that these days people are consuming
                    more digital content than ever, has led to myriads of
                    sources of content on the internet. This has put increased
                    pressure on content creators to come up with the best,
                    fool-proof practices for creating content that is not only
                    engaging but also impactful. It is rightly proclaimed that
                    "Content is King" and therefore it should be the objective
                    of every content creator that their digital material adds
                    value to their customer's life. This can seem like a
                    daunting task if you're just venturing into this realm. We
                    have compiled a comprehensive list of the best practices for
                    online content creation to provide you with a little boost
                    in your endeavours.
                  </p>
                  <h6>1. Know your Target Audience</h6>
                  <p>
                    "Target" is the key term here. Contrary to what you might
                    believe writing for a broad range of the audience is not an
                    effective content strategy. It can actually result in the
                    opposite direction of attaining the primary goal, which is
                    to gain traffic and other objectives like increasing sales,
                    boosting the number of subscribers, lead generation etc.
                    Before you start creating content, do thorough research
                    about the kind of audience profile you want to attract. Once
                    you have locked in this information you can start
                    customising your content to cater to their needs and
                    expectations. Many individuals and organisations like to
                    utilise Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to perform this
                    task. The dictionary definition of a KPI is that it is a
                    measurable goal that demonstrates how effectively the
                    business objectives of an organisation are being realised.
                    Content creators can use various metrics to determine the
                    type of audience they are attracting the most, the list of
                    their most visited and least visited pages, behaviour
                    patterns etc. Some of the most valuable KPIs are:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Sales Revenue</li>
                    <li>Online Marketing ROI</li>
                    <li>Site Traffic to Lead Ratio</li>
                    <li>Number of shares</li>
                    <li>Client Retention Rate</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    To gain a more comprehensive understanding of KPIs refer to
                    Salesforce Pardot's article titled "14 Content Marketing
                    KPIs You Should Be Tracking" [1].
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you ever encounter a roadblock while writing content
                    always remember that you are producing this content solely
                    to satisfy your potential customers. Put yourself in their
                    shoes for a moment and think of how you would want this
                    particular product/service information to be conveyed to
                    you. Perhaps you would create a Question and Answer segment,
                    write a descriptive blog post or maybe produce engaging
                    visual content to get your message across. It ultimately
                    depends on how creatively you develop valuable content to
                    adhere to the customers' needs and your business goals.
                  </p>
                  <h6>2. Engage in Keyword Search</h6>
                  <p>
                    The purpose of spending a huge amount of time and energy in
                    publishing relevant content is to attract views or
                    "eyeballs" as it is sometimes referred to in the marketing
                    world. To attract more visitors to your business you need to
                    invest significant time in keyword research. This is the
                    foundational step for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)[3].
                    Always keep SEO in mind as it is a heavily employed
                    technique used in digital marketing to increase the number
                    of prospects that find your content through a search engine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Begin by researching the most searched keywords related to
                    your topic, also determine what the least searched keywords
                    are. Also, keep track of related keywords that do not seem
                    to have a lot of competition. Most often than not short tail
                    keywords have fierce competition while long tail keywords
                    are often seldom used. You can use this lack of competition
                    to your advantage and incorporate the long tail keywords in
                    your content. For example, if you are a computer science
                    teacher who is trying to get subscribers for their online
                    C++ course you would probably find that keywords such as
                    "c++ for beginners" have high monthly searches whereas
                    "certified online course on c++ programming for beginners"
                    might not. Using lesser-used long tail keywords is an
                    excellent way of improving your search ranking and getting
                    more leads, subscribers and/or customers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are multiple services available on the internet to
                    help you perform this task. These include both free and paid
                    services. Google Keyword Planner [4] is an excellent free
                    tool for researching, discovering and analysing relevant
                    keywords. If you have the capital to invest in paid keyword
                    search tools you can opt for SEMrush [5] which is a highly
                    popular tool that claims unmatched and superior performance.
                    One noteworthy point here is to not restrict yourself to one
                    such service. Make sure you employ the use of numerous
                    keyword search tools because results from different services
                    are known to vary from time to time. Search the web for
                    ideas on how to optimise the title of your content piece,
                    scroll through social media platforms to determine what
                    hashtags are trending and customise your content according
                    to your findings. Most importantly, do not use popular
                    keywords just for the sake of using them, make sure they are
                    relevant to your topic and fit the context well. You can
                    refer to Brian Dean's article titled
                    <strong
                      >"15 BEST Keyword Research Tools for SEO " [2] to get

                      are currently available."</strong

                  <h6>3. Put a Unique Touch to your Content</h6>
                  <p>
                    We have established the powerful role that SEO plays in the
                    content creation process. There are many SEO tools available
                    in the market that you can use to increase your SEO score. A
                    simple way of obtaining a higher SEO score is publishing
                    unique content. Unique content refers to content that is
                    original and has not been plagiarised. Unique content sets
                    you apart from other sources that are giving out similar
                    information to the audience and hence greatly increases the
                    chances of your content getting the spotlight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let us understand this better through an example. Consider a
                    scenario wherein a potential customer searches for
                    "certified training in web development with python" via a
                    search engine. The search engine will then employ complex
                    algorithms to search for the best sources that offer an
                    answer to the user's search query and provide a list of
                    helpful content that is going to be ranked in order of
                    decreasing relevance and content quality. There are going to
                    be various other organisations and independents that will be
                    offering their services, to cut through the competition you
                    would have to make sure that your content is unique and has
                    not been duplicated from anywhere else. You can accomplish
                    this by mentioning that you provide a free 3-day trial
                    period or that you conduct live doubt sessions at the end of
                    every week. You are essentially providing unique incentives
                    to your potential customers for picking your service over
                    your competitors' services
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Search engines levy heavy penalties on sources that try to
                    cheat their algorithms with duplicated data. To avoid any
                    such penalties we suggest the following points
                  </p>

                  <ol type="1">
                    <li>
                      Utilise your own writing style to come up with quality
                      content. Do not try to copy the writing style of other
                      content creators, this will only backfire in your effort
                      to rank better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Do not try to imitate the content format of your
                      competitors. Create content keeping specific channels in
                      mind
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use your own reasoning and logical abilities to explain
                      why your product/service is superior to others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If possible, use your own original audio clips and video
                      clips. The more fresh your pieces of content are the
                      better they will rank in the search engine indexing
                      process.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <h6>4. Gradually get into the workflow</h6>
                  <p>
                    It has been observed that a number of people who already
                    have settled upon a content idea struggle with getting
                    started with the actual content creation process. The
                    introductory part of your content can be the most
                    challenging to finalise. It requires a lot of brainstorming
                    and editing, therefore it is generally recommended to not
                    fret about it too much and start with the piece of content
                    you are most sure of. Do not worry about dividing the
                    material into various segments and pick individual segments
                    to work on. Once you start writing and creating content you
                    will gradually get into the flow of things and bring the
                    entire work to completion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once you are done with the first draft make sure that you
                    proofread, perform a content audit and look for any errors
                    that you might have made. You can also ask for someone
                    else's help for this as long as they have some knowledge in
                    the subject. You will find that there are quite a few
                    modifications to be done and this will help you in producing
                    the final cut of your ace quality content.
                  </p>
                  <h6>5. Work on your Content Marketing Strategy</h6>
                  <p>
                    Search engines like Google, Yahoo etc. will not rank your
                    content at the top right at the beginning, it is going to
                    take some time for you to get there. Till the time that
                    happens, you can focus on content promotion through social
                    media. You can research the hashtags that your target
                    audience is using and then come up with kinds of content
                    that are on-brand with your product/service. You can use
                    creative ways to carry out the promotion drive depending
                    upon the social media platform you are using, for instance:
                  </p>
                  <ol type="1">
                    <li>
                      If you plan to do an Instagram Live session then you need
                      to make sure you host an interactive and engaging session
                      so as to persuade people to sign up for your
                      product/service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you have published some articles or blogs on your
                      product/service you can repurpose them and share them as
                      social media posts and as part of your emails. Just make
                      sure they are not very wordy and accompany the posts with
                      some compelling visuals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You can also opt for content advertising if you want to
                      have a successful content marketing campaign handled by a
                      professional content team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Always make use of accurate titles so that search engines
                      can pick up your content easily.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    You will find that over time the bounce rate of your content
                    will decrease and its ranking will gradually improve.
                    Lastly, it is important that you keep updating your content
                    with trending keywords to attract traffic and work on
                    content amplification by publishing content that is
                    meaningful and relevant to your subject.
