                    Email marketing is an unparalleled digital marketing
                    strategy. For teachers and instructors, it is about more
                    than just promoting their courses by sending unlimited
                    emails—it is a way to easily connect with students and
                    simplify their online teaching journey. Selecting the right
                    email marketing tools is a crucial step in advertising your
                    online course. Email marketing tools enable a user to
                    create, implement and monitor their email campaign. Some
                    email marketing applications are equipped with email content
                    builders, scheduling options, and others have advanced
                    features including marketing automation tools that can save
                    the user from repetitive tasks. With these tools, the users
                    can also get a better insight into important performance
                    metrics that they can utilize to update their marketing
                    strategy for the best results. Before jumping into the best
                    tools available for email marketing of your online course
                    let us comprehend what email marketing is and why it is
                    considered an essential distribution medium.
                  </p>
                  <h6>What is Email Marketing?</h6>
                  <p>
                    Email marketing simply refers to the use of emails to
                    convert leads into sales by sending personalized business
                    messages to the target audience. Email marketing is a
                    decades-old marketing channel that is considered to be one
                    of the most potent marketing channels. In spite of being an
                    old-school marketing medium, it is considered anything but
                    that. Even in 2021, it proves to be one of the most reliable
                    and popular online channels to promote your product or
                    service. A research report on Statista states that in 2020,
                    approximately 306 billion emails were sent and received
                    every day worldwide. This figure is projected to increase to
                    over 376 billion daily emails in 2025 [1]. Statistics state
                    that as many as 87% of marketers use promotional emails for
                    content dissemination [2]. With this email marketing
                    statistic in mind, it is unwise to ignore the potential of a
                    powerful email marketing campaign.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consider the case of Harry’s [3], a business that sells
                    personal grooming products and shaving tools through both
                    digital and retail stores. Their subscription model offers
                    monthly or weekly delivery of products chosen based on the
                    customer’s unique profile and skincare needs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since its inception in 2013, the brand has gone to great
                    lengths to ensure that its direct-to-consumer (DTC) product
                    is a success. As a result, Harry’s has built a brand worth
                    $1.4B.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>What They Did: </strong>According to a case study of
                    their marketing, among their 5-prong marketing approach,
                    their most interesting strategy was their very first email
                    marketing campaign. All 12 of their employees sent emails to
                    everyone they knew in their very own personal and
                    professional networks. In only a week, they grew their
                    customer list to 100,000 subscribers using this incredibly
                    simple direct marketing tactic. They then set up a dedicated
                    landing page and followed it up with giving away offers and
                    discounts!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are several benefits associated with email marketing.
