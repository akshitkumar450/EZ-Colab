                    Are you a course creator who finds themselves getting
                    increasingly flustered while thinking about attaching the
                    right price tag to their course? If yes, you have landed on
                    the right page. By the end of this article, you will have a
                    clear idea about the best approach to deciding the price of
                    your online course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most course creators grapple with finding the sweet spot in
                    online course pricing where they get to achieve their profit
                    goals and their loyal customers are still satisfied with the
                    product. The reason so many course instructors struggle with
                    this step is because, like most entrepreneurs, they realize
                    how crucial it is to select the right price for their
                    course. This is a decision that should be taken after a lot
                    of strategic planning and not by estimated guesswork. The
                    crux of the significance of a pricing strategy is that the
                    higher you can price your course without causing a
                    substantial drop in sales volume, the more revenue you will
                    generate. Also, if you raise prices while keeping your
                    costs, including the marketing spend and cost of your email
                    campaign, constant, the more money you will make.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before we jump onto the steps you should keep in mind while
                    deciding on a profitable online course price, let us take a
                    look at the three different price tiers you can adopt.
                  </p>
                  <h6>1. Free Courses:</h6>
                  <p>
                    Many educational platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Skillshare
                    etc. host numerous free courses. Some of the commonly listed
                    reasons for educators to offer free courses are:
                  </p>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                      Course creators who publish their pilot course on their
                      websites decide to advertise it through their email list
                      in order to build trust with their subscribers
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Established course creators offer free courses as a means
                      to generate more leads
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Free content can be seen as a good way to increase the SEO
                      of the creator's website consequently resulting in more
                      website traffic
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In order to sell another service or product, instructors
                      sometimes include a free course as bonus content in
                      exchange for customers signing up for that other service
                      or product. For instance, if the instructor has designed a
                      6-week summer training program, they might offer one of
                      their courses as an incentive for people to register for
                      their training program.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <h6>2. Paid Courses:</h6>
                  <p>
                    Paid courses can be found everywhere. In this category, when
                    we say "paid courses" we refer to the Pay-per-course model.
                    Interested students pay for the individual courses that they
                    want to sign-up for. The range of prices for these courses
                    is diverse and one can find a course at almost any and every
                    price point. This model provides immediate revenue
                    generation and empowers the customers as they get to pay
                    only for the course that they want to sign-up for.
                  </p>
                  <h6>3. Subscription/Membership model</h6>
                  <p>
                    Subscriptions and Memberships are online educational models
                    where people can subscribe to, or take membership of, a
                    service by paying instalments on a monthly or yearly basis.
                    Course creators offer one or all of their courses
                    continually as long as the members are paying their due.
                    There are a lot of membership pricing plans that can be
                    offered to the customers as well as amazing financial
                    benefits. This model also offers a recurring revenue stream
                    for your business and is therefore gaining popularity with
                    many course creators. If you want to learn more about this
                    education model, click here to read KJ McGowan's article

                    [1].
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now that we are acquainted with the three available pricing
                    options, let us dive right into understanding how course
                    creators, such as yourself, should go about pricing their
                    online courses.
                  </p>
                  <h6>1. Define Your Income Goals</h6>
                  <p>
                    Having a clear strategy in mind is imperative before you
                    start selecting the price of your online course. After all,
                    the price point will drive many crucial factors such as:
                  </p>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>Increasing penetration in the current market</li>
                    <li>Entering a new market</li>
                    <li>Establishing your brand name</li>
                    <li>Impacting the revenue you will earn</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Course creation is an excellent way of earning a living. It
                    is a noble endeavour, after all, you are offering a
                    well-structured form of high-quality information to
                    interested people so that they can benefit from it. This
                    being said, course creation is also a time-consuming
                    process, naturally, you would expect to earn a substantial
                    income from it. Different course creators may have different
                    income goals in mind. Some might be planning to turn this
                    online business as their primary income source while others
                    may see the online course sales as a source of passive
                    income.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Start by determining your revenue goals. Think about how
                    much you would like to make in a yearly income and then
                    break that down to what you would need to make on a monthly
                    basis. This will help you figure out the approximate price
                    you would need to charge for your course. Next, think about
                    all the hours you put in and all the added expenses that
                    went into the production stage of the course creation
                    process. This should provide you with some clarity on the
                    optimal price of your course.
                  </p>
                  <h6>2. Determine the Value of Your Course Outcomes</h6>
                  <p>
                    Think long and hard about the value your course will deliver
                    to your students. It is the course outcomes that will help
                    you in determining what your carefully designed online
                    course is worth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a student successfully learns and applies what you are
                    teaching, how valuable will the outcome be for them? Will
                    your potential students have a chance to make more money now
                    that they have additional skills in their repertoire? Can
                    they expand their personal or professional brand? You don't
                    need to have a quantifiable answer to these questions, only
                    a definite one. Like we said before, think long and hard
                    about the positive value that will be attributed to the
                    students and then put a price tag on them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While you are brainstorming about these positive outcomes,
                    take a moment to talk to your potential customers. You can
                    do this by using your email list to reach out to people and
                    ask them to participate in surveys or interviews pertaining
                    to their views on the price value of course outcomes.
                    Analyse these responses and integrate your own reasoning
                    into them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, determine the minimum value that you are certain
                    that your course is worth, and take into consideration the
                    following two parameters before arriving on the actual price
                    you would be setting for the course:
                  </p>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                      A high return on investment that the prospective customers
                      would achieve
                    </li>
                    <li>A decent rate of return for you</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    By now, it must be pretty clear that setting an online
                    course price is not as straightforward a process as one
                    might assume it to be, however, it can be effectively done.
                    Put in sincere efforts at this stage of your course creation
                    journey and your online course business is sure to benefit
                    from it in the long run.
                  </p>

                  <h6>3. Perform Industry Research</h6>
                  <p>
                    A common piece of advice that we are sure you will stumble
                    upon on the Internet is to research the price range that
                    your competitors are offering and then assign the median
                    value to your course. This would be a bad idea. Let us
                    understand why.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engaging in industry research and finding out what other
                    professionals in your industry are charging for their
                    courses is indeed a good idea to get an estimated price that
                    online learners are willing to pay. However, basing the
                    price value of your course solely according to that is not a
                    wise move. The factors that should dictate the price tag on
                    a course are the value outcomes that the students will
                    benefit from and the expertise and guidance that you will be
                    putting in to help them achieve those benefits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Apply the same concept that you apply at the beginning of
                    your course creation journey when you research your
                    competitors to gain insights into what course outcomes they
                    have put on offer or what unique selling points are making
                    the audience sign-up for the courses. Research your
                    competition to simply gain insights on the different price
                    points and to validate the market demand of your topic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is also possible that you have a totally new online
                    course idea and therefore have no existing competitors to
                    perform the preliminary industry research. Do not worry,
                    trust the pioneer in you and be the first person to set a
                    premium price on that course topic. In fact, you can
                    increase the perceived value of your course by leveraging
                    the scarcity and highlighting the unique benefits of
                    enrolling in your course and even aim towards setting a
                    higher price point if you are sure that there is decent
                    market demand.

                  <h6>4. Do Not Underprice Your Course</h6>
                  <p>
                    If you are planning to sell your first online course you
                    probably have had the following thoughts centred around
                    lower pricing in your mind:

                        What if my audience is not willing to pay the ideal
                        price for the course?
                      </em>
                    </li>

                      </em>
                    </li>

                        an advantage over my competition and increase my
                        returns.
                      </em>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Let's discuss these common conundrums one at a time.</p>

                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                      <em>
                        "What if my audience is not willing to pay the ideal
                        price for the course?"
                      </em>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      Remember that a good online course has value. And people
                      are always willing to pay for something that is valuable.
                      If you are sure that you have created a course that will
                      intrigue your audience by teaching them something that is
                      new, fresh and unique, put a price tag that reinforces
                      that fact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When people pay money for something – regardless of
                      whether it is an online course, a product or an experience
                      – they tend to assign more value to their purchase. This
                      encourages them to complete the course and truly imbibe
                      the benefits it offers. This positive experience turns the
                      students into happy customers and happy customers give
                      rise to more mouth referrals. Hence, proper pricing can
                      lead to a wider sales funnel.
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      <em>
                        "My course is not as long as my competitors', I should
                        charge less than the average price."
                      </em>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      Many online instructors think that they need to create a
                      very long course in order to set a high price for the
                      course.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a common misconception.</p>
                    <p>
                      The length of your online course should in no way be a
                      determining factor in setting your course price. Your
                      course should be priced based on the value of its content
                      and not its length. Every teacher has a teaching style
                      that is unique to that individual. One instructor might
                      take a few weeks to teach a particular topic while another
                      equally competent teacher might take a couple of days.
                      Similarly, it does not matter if your course has 20
                      modules spanning 1 hour each or 10 modules spanning half
                      an hour each. It is the value of the course material,
                      course outcomes and the expertise you have incorporated in
                      the lessons that decide the worth of the course.
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      <em>
                        "If I charge less than my competitors, that will give me
                        an advantage over my competition and increase my
                        returns."
                      </em>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      Several online instructors who are venturing into the
                      world of online education for the first time are tempted
                      to slash the price of their courses thinking this move
                      will reward them with significant returns. However, the
                      experience of many course creators has proved otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you price your course low then you’re harming its
                      perceived value. Your customers will assume that your
                      course is not worth a higher price. These customers form
                      the section of people who are serious about acquiring new
                      skills and are ready to pay a premium price in exchange
                      for quality education that is delivered in an effective
                      and organized manner under the guidance of the instructor.
                      Therefore, it is not a good business decision to
                      intentionally price your course lower than its actual
                      value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Besides, if you really think about it, selling a
                      low-priced course requires just as much effort as selling
                      a higher-priced course. You would probably have the same
                      marketing strategy too! The process of you guiding someone
                      through to purchase a lower-priced course won’t vary a lot
                      from the process of you guiding them through to buy a
                      higher-priced one. You would be losing out on capitalising
                      on your efforts and gaining a higher revenue if you
                      underprice your course.

                  <h6>5. Provide different Pricing Structures</h6>
                  <p>
                    People love having multiple options and choosing the
                    alternative which they think is most favourable to their
                    needs. The same psychological process applies to the time
                    when your prospective students are presented with multiple
                    course options at different price points. Also, people have
                    different goals while signing up for an online course. Some
                    may want only the fundamental knowledge pertaining to that
                    subject while others might be looking for a more
                    comprehensive guide. It is important that you take this
                    issue into consideration while forming your pricing
                    strategy. To navigate this issue we suggest you offer
                    multiple price points to your target market. For instance,
                    you can provide the following options:
                  </p>

                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                      <strong> Free Mini-Course: </strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      You can formulate this free mini-course by extracting a
                      part of the valuable content from your course and
                      packaging it as teaser content, a sample course that
                      interested students can opt for. This sample content
                      should contain only the basics of your course with little
                      to no engaging features such as practical experiments or
                      case studies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Mini-courses are also great for lead generation as well as
                      for increasing your online audience. (Read: How to Grow

                      <strong>Upgraded Version: </strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      The upgraded version should include all the features of
                      the free mini-course along with direct access to
                      downloadable resources and a certificate of completion.

                    <p>
                      The Premium version of your course would include all
                      features of the upgraded version in addition to live
                      sessions for teacher-student and student-student
                      interaction.

                    <p>
                      The best part about offering different pricing tiers is
                      that no matter which of your price options people choose,
                      you still end up gaining a customer!

                  <h6>6. Keep Testing Your Price Point</h6>
                  <p>
                    The process of pricing is not set in stone, it is a dynamic
                    part of any business. It is almost a given that as a course
                    creator you would need to try out different price points in
                    the initial stages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While testing different price points, it is advised that you
                    should start with a low price and then gradually attempt a
                    price increase. Keep increasing the price till the time your
                    sales volume starts plateauing. If all other variables were
                    kept the same, this would imply that you have approached the
                    peak value of what your target market is willing to spend
                    for your course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gradually, with the help of all the tips mentioned above and
                    your own learning experience, you will make correct
                    estimations with respect to the pricing strategy of your
                    online course.
