                  <p>
                    Personal development is a way for individuals to maximize
                    their potential and reach their target goals in life through
                    introspection and working towards building new skills in
                    life. It has been observed that self-help books and books
                    about self-improvement perform consistently well in the
                    market. With self-improvement courses, people can learn how
                    to enhance their quality of life, develop their capabilities
                    and realize their dreams and aspirations.

                    A statistics report by Market Research reports that by 2022
                    the self improvement industry state will have an estimated
                    growth of $13.2 billion with 5.6% average yearly gains [2].
                    Now, more than ever, people are focused on improving the
                    quality of their lives by working on self-improvement.
                    Hence, this is a lucrative industry to enter into through
                    the medium of an online academy or a series of individual
                    courses.

                    Nowadays, an increasing number of people living in urban

                    in such a way that people find them easy to follow.

                    engine optimisation techniques to ensure that their content
                    ranks closer to the top. If you are someone with an

                  <h6>9. Office Productivity</h6>
                  <p>
                    Office productivity tools are software applications that
                    facilitate the viewing, creating, altering and inserting
                    general office documents such as official letters,
                    spreadsheets, presentations, databases, memos etc.
                    Productivity tools are widely employed in offices and
                    therefore it is imperative for employees to be well versed
                    in knowing how to use them to increase their efficiency at
                    work. For instance, using a simple database management
                    application like MS Excel can make the tasks of storing data
                    and applying different mathematical operations on it so much
                    more efficient than using a calculator and doing it
                    manually. You can build a big online community of people
                    desiring to learn such office productivity tools.

                    as IELTS and TOEFL have 3.5 million and 2.3 million test
                    takers per year. Over half a million individuals across 160
                    countries take the GRE General Test every year while more
                    than 300,000 people opt for GMAT.
