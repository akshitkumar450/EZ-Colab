                    Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started raging havoc on the
                    entire world the number of people resorting to online
                    learning platforms has greatly increased. Thousands of
                    students and working professionals took to popular and
                    reliable educational platforms like Coursera, Udemy,
                    Skillshare, LinkedIn Learning among others, that provide an
                    online environment in order to make productive use of their
                    time and to expand their knowledge while they had the
                    opportunity. If you refuse to accept this fact at face
                    value, take a moment to look at the bevy of impressive
                    statistics behind it. As of 2020, the market for mobile
                    e-learning had grown by $38 billion dollars. According to a
                    study by KPMG in India, the Indian online education market
                    is set to grow to USD 1.96 billion and around 9.6 million
                    users by 2021 from USD 247 million and around 1.6 million
                    users in 2016. Reskilling and online certifications are the
                    largest category in 2021 and stand at USD 93 million.
                    Primary and secondary supplemental education will be the
                    largest category by the end of 2021 at USD 773 million,
                    growing at a compound annual growth rate of 60%. Competitive
                    test preparation will be the fastest-growing category in
                    2021, growing at a compound annual growth rate of an
                    astounding 64%. Therefore, it is safe to say that the growth
                    rate for online learning will not be relapsing any time
                    soon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the ever-growing accessibility of the internet and the
                    rising popularity of online learning platforms, there has
                    been a fierce debate about the benefits and drawbacks of
                    e-learning as opposed to those of offline learning. The
                    conventional method of teaching, which is referred to as
                    offline learning, does not require an internet connection
                    and therefore has a major advantage over online education.
                    This provides a benefit to those people who do not have
                    internet access. It also provides a sense of familiarity to
                    interested learners. It involves having a teacher present in
                    the classroom to moderate the students during the lesson and
                    to help maintain discipline and focus. However, there has
                    been a growing trend towards online education platforms due
                    to the ease of access to resources and flexibility they
                    provide especially in a time where physically attending a
                    class is fraught with peril. A host of educational
                    institutes including schools. tuition centers, coaching
                    centers, and colleges have adopted the online environment to
                    ensure an uninterrupted journey to an interested learner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is not to say that digital learning does not come with
                    its own set of drawbacks. Before getting on board with
                    distance learning and enrolling yourself in an online course
                    it is imperative that you are aware of the problems that
                    might not always be talked about but still plague this
                    industry. Only then is it advised that you decide between
                    opting for a traditional education or an online program.
                    Here is a carefully compiled list of the drawbacks of online
                    education:
                  </p>
                  <h6>
                    1. Lack of Communication between Student and Teacher -
                  </h6>
                  <p>
                    Though Education Technology companies are constantly
                    researching new ways to improve their software programs
                    there is no denying the communication gap that develops
                    between the instructor and the students. Often lectures
                    don't feel like an open discussion and present no avenue for
                    the students to voice any doubt or opinion that they might
                    have regarding the subject. Online courses are also
                    optimally scheduled such that an instructor can cover a
                    maximum number of classes in an efficient way, this of
                    course means that time is of the essence, and as soon as one
                    lecture ends the instructor might have to join another
                    session just as quickly. You will come across many people in
                    your life who confidently maintain that self-study is the
                    only step required to completely and efficiently master the
                    education you are receiving, but there is no doubt that
                    having a functional and healthy relationship with your
                    teacher will have a positive impact on you. In this aspect,
                    traditional learning environments have an obvious advantage
                    over the online learning environment.
                  </p>
                  <h6>2. Lack of Feedback-</h6>
                  <p>
                    Traditional learning provides the subject matter experts
                    with the opportunity to give feedback to the students
                    directly in the class. Such personalized feedback can offer
                    great insights to the students and help motivate them as
                    well. Similarly, in a physical classroom, people can voice
                    ideas that they think can help improve the learning process.
                    The pupils are in fact encouraged to put forth their
                    suggestions to the teacher as this helps boost the
                    interaction level in the class. On the other hand, when it
                    comes to online lectures oftentimes there are no means for
                    the students to provide feedback on the quality of the
                    online class. This disadvantage becomes even more
                    problematic when a student faces genuine obstacles in
                    understanding the course curriculum but has no way of
                    approaching their instructor. As a result, these queries
                    might keep on piling up significantly affecting the learning
                    of the student.
                  </p>
                  <h6>3. Sense of Isolation-</h6>
                  <p>
                    Another drawback associated with learning an online program
                    is the feeling of isolation that students might experience.
                    The methods of teaching currently being used in e-learning
                    platforms do not facilitate a lot of human-to-human
                    interaction which can lead to the feeling of social
                    isolation especially at the time of a global pandemic. There
                    is often no provision of a digital space where the online
                    students can virtually assemble to have a friendly and
                    productive interaction with each other. These digital spaces
                    can also be utilized to initiate class discussions wherein
                    students can exchange ideas and viewpoints pertaining to the
                    subject being studied. In addition to this lack of
                    peer-to-peer interaction the attribute of remoteness, which
                    is another characteristic of the online environment, can
                    also result in the students being easily demotivated since
                    there would be a lack of friendly competition between them.
                    To combat this problem, a few institutions have initiated
                    blended learning techniques that encourage face-to-face
                    interaction among students with the help of video
                    conferencing and also scheduling regular discussion forums
                    to maintain personal contact.
                  </p>
                  <h6>4. Requirement of Self-Motivation Skills-</h6>
                  <p>
                    To overcome all the drawbacks mentioned above it is crucial
                    that an individual believes he or she is equipped with the
                    tenacity to see things all the way through before signing up
                    for virtual learning. When we say that you need serious
                    self-motivation skills we mean that it is absolutely
                    imperative that you have them. In a traditional classroom
                    setting a student has an easier time maintaining his or her
                    focus on the course material. Advantages like face-to-face
                    conversations with the instructors, the option to raise
                    doubts and opinions in class, and interaction with fellow
                    students all contribute to making the offline learning
                    environment an engaging one. These also help a student in
                    adhering to the strict deadlines provided by most online
                    schools by developing excellent time management skills.
                    However, since an online learning environment fails to
                    facilitate these things the online student is left to his
                    own devices. Only with consistent, never-ending
                    determination and unyielding self-motivation can online
                    students keep up with the challenging tasks of online
                    courses.
                  </p>
                  <h6>5. Online Programs are Limited to Certain Subjects-</h6>
                  <p>
                    Between the alternatives of doing a course on natural
                    history or one on how to perform a medical autopsy, which
                    one do you reckon will be more beneficial to an individual
                    student? Hopefully, we have the same answer here which is
                    the former option. All disciplines in education are not at
                    par with each other and therefore not all online programs
                    can cater to their students in a fully efficient manner.
                    Some fields of study naturally require a more hands-on
                    approach for example medicine, engineering sciences,
                    aviation, etc. while others like humanities and social
                    sciences seem to be a better fit for the online mode of
                    education. Because after all, you would not want your doctor
                    to perform an operation on you when he only ever had
                    performed an operation in a simulated environment or hire a
                    product engineer who has had no exposure to how real-world
                    industries operate. Complicated subjects and practices that
                    demand a physical environment cannot be fully transformed
                    into the online method of teaching. Online degrees offered
                    in theoretical subjects that have more repetitive topics and
                    little to no requirement of practice-based learning prove to
                    be excellent choices for online courses. Of course, this
                    argument is subject to change in the future depending on the
                    level of technological innovations that humanity reaches to.
                    There might well come a time when all disciplines in
                    education can be efficiently taught by online lessons.
